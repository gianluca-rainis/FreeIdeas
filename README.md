FreeIdeas is a site where you can publish your ideas about any type of projects, and where you can find inspiration for your next project.

You can search for ideas, publish your own ideas, ask for help on your ideas, or just browse through the ideas of others.

The published ideas are free to use, and you can use them as you wish, without any restrictions (except for the ones mentioned in the license).

The site is open to everyone, and you can contribute by publishing your own ideas or by helping others with their ideas.

The goal of FreeIdeas is to create an international community of creatives who share their ideas and help each other to bring them to life.

If you have an idea that you want to share with the world, or if you are looking for inspiration for your next project, FreeIdeas is the place for you.

## 📝 Presentation of the project
### Philosophy
For us, **all ideas are equal**, and as such, **they deserve equal visibility** on the site. We ensure this equality by **highlighting the latest 22 ideas published on our home page** and automatically sorting them in reverse chronological order on the search page.

**All ideas on the site are public**, allowing anyone to view them, contribute advice, and **draw inspiration from the creativity** of others.

### Purpose
The project aims to promote **freedom of expression** and **digital inclusion**, allowing creatives to share their ideas with the world, without being labeled or judged.

The ideal goal is to create an *international* and *intercultural* community of creative people who share their ideas and projects in a healthy and constructive way, even **helping each other** to implement their ideas.

This is why the site is in **English**: to allow anyone, **regardless of their geographic location, language, or culture**, to participate by posting their ideas.
As the site develops and expands, it is highly likely that sub-communities will also develop that post ideas *in their native language*, thus allowing even those *who do not speak English* to participate equally, **without excluding anyone**.

### Meaning of the logo
The project's name, FreeIdeas, means "Free Ideas" and immediately captures the core concept: offering a **space open to everyone's ideas**.

The logo is simple and clean:
- The word "**Free**" features letters colored in various shades of *green*, with a *soft, harmonious font* that conveys continuity and completeness;
- The word "**Ideas**" uses a different shade of *yellow* for each letter, with a font reminiscent of *a sketchy yet carefully crafted text*, evoking creativity and originality.

The logo as a whole **conveys creativity, care, and hospitality**: every idea, even if only sketched or incomplete, can find its place on the site.

The logo's colors were carefully chosen and have profound meanings. **Green evokes nature**, a symbol of *vitality, strength, and continuity*, also suggesting the responsibility to care for it so it doesn't decay. **Yellow evokes gold**, recalling what is *precious, rare, and valuable*, underscoring the importance of every idea.

### Meaning of the slogan
The slogan we chose for the project aims to summarize the site's purpose:
'**A place where your Ideas can be Free**', This short and concise phrase **captures the site's purpose: to provide a place where anyone's ideas can be valued**.
The word 'your' is in bold to emphasize that **the site exists solely for the user**, and that *without creatives publishing their ideas, it would cease to have any purpose*.
