            <h2>1.1 Definition of "Non-Commercial Use"</h2>
            <p><em>Non-commercial use</em> refers to any use <strong>not primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or monetary compensation</strong>, including but not limited to:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Personal publication without monetized ads;</li>
                <li>Educational or academic use within nonprofit institutions;</li>
                <li>Use within nonprofit organizations that do not sell, license, or commercially promote services based on this project.</li>

            <p>The author reserves the right to assess and clarify borderline cases.</p>

            <h1>2. Derivative Works</h1>
            <p>The creation and distribution of non-commercial derivative works is permitted, provided that:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>The original FreeIdeas License is <strong>included in full and unmodified</strong>;</li>
                <li><strong>Clear and visible</strong> attribution is given, stating that the work is derived from or inspired by the FreeIdeas project;</li>
                <li>The derivative work is released under the same FreeIdeas License, without adding or removing any permissions or restrictions.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Any such redistribution must not involve direct or indirect commercial use.</p>

            <h2>2.1 Definition of Derivative Work</h2>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Commercial use</strong> of any part of this project, whether direct or indirect (e.g., selling, licensing, monetizing, providing services based on the project), is strictly prohibited unless prior written permission is obtained from the author.</li>
                <li>The use of the name "<em>FreeIdeas</em>" and any associated <strong>logos or visual identifiers</strong> in any form, variation, or color is <strong>not allowed</strong> without <strong>explicit written authorization</strong>.</li>
