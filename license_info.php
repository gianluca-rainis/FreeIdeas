            <h2>Copyright (c) 2025, FreeIdeas by Gianluca Rainis</h2>

            <p>Permission is hereby granted to any individual to use this project for personal, non-commercial purposes without prior written authorization.</p>

            <h2>Redistribution of Derivative Works</h2>
            <p>Individuals are permitted to distribute personal, non-commercial derivative works, provided that:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The original FreeIdeas License is included unmodified;</li>

                <li>Clear attribution is given, explicitly stating that the work is derived from or inspired by the FreeIdeas project;</li>

                <li>The derivative work is released under the same FreeIdeas License and with no additional permissions, restrictions, or changes in terms.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>Any such redistribution must not involve direct or indirect commercial use.</p>

            <h2>Restrictions</h2>
            <p>Commercial use of any part of this project — including but not limited to code, design, media, or structure — is strictly prohibited unless prior written consent is provided by the author.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Any use of the project's source code, in whole or in part, must include written attribution clearly stating that the work is derived from or inspired by the FreeIdeas project.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The use of the FreeIdeas name, or the FreeIdeas logo in any form, color, or variation is not permitted without explicit written permission from the author.</p>
            <br>
            <p>This license is non-transferable, non-sublicensable, and must be included with any redistributions of derived or referenced work.</p>

            <h2>Dual Attribution & Commercial Approval Clause</h2>

            <p>In cases where derivative works are built successively by multiple contributors — each reusing or modifying parts of the original FreeIdeas project or its derivatives:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Any party seeking direct or indirect commercial use of such derivative must obtain *explicit written permission from all contributors involved in the chain of derivation*, including the original author of FreeIdeas and any intermediate contributors whose work was incorporated.</li>

                <li>Authorization granted by the FreeIdeas author to a downstream contributor does *not* grant commercial rights to any other contributor or participant in the derivation chain.</li>

                <li>No contributor is permitted to issue commercial rights or sublicenses on behalf of the original author or any upstream participant.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>Each individual in the derivation chain remains independently responsible for adhering to the FreeIdeas License. Commercial use at any level is strictly prohibited without full consent from all relevant parties involved.</p>

            <h2>Attribution Chain Clause</h2>

            <p>In the creation or distribution of derivative works that incorporate any portion of the FreeIdeas project, contributors are required to maintain a complete and traceable attribution chain.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Any contributor must explicitly credit:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The original FreeIdeas project and its author;</li>
                <li>All intermediate contributors whose work has been incorporated;</li>
                <li>The immediate upstream source from which the derivative was built.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>This attribution must be clearly stated and accessible in the published work or documentation.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The purpose of this clause is to ensure full transparency, uphold the integrity of derivative efforts, and preserve historical linkage to FreeIdeas as the origin point. Failure to honor the complete attribution chain constitutes a violation of this license.</p>
            <br>
            <p>THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED.</p>
