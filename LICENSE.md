A derivative work is defined as any project, code, design, document, or content that **modifies, extends, incorporates, adapts, or is substantially based on** this project.

# 3. Commercial Use and Permissions
- **Commercial use** of any part of this project, whether direct or indirect (e.g., selling, licensing, monetizing, providing services based on the project), is strictly prohibited unless prior written permission is obtained from the author.

- This license is non-transferable and non-sublicensable.

# 4. Attribution and Traceability Clause
Any distributed or derivative work must include **complete and traceable attribution**, listing:

- Any intermediate contributors whose work has been incorporated;

- The immediate upstream source from which the current work is derived.

This attribution must be **clearly visible and publicly accessible** within the project documentation or metadata.

The purpose of this clause is to ensure full transparency, uphold the integrity of derivative efforts, and preserve historical linkage to FreeIdeas as the origin point. Failure to honor the complete attribution chain constitutes a violation of this license.

- Any party seeking **commercial use** of a derivative must obtain **explicit written permission from**:

    - The original author of FreeIdeas;

    - **All intermediate contributors** involved in the derivation chain.

All versions of the FreeIdeas project, unless explicitly stated otherwise, are governed by the latest published version of the FreeIdeas License.

This ensures consistent terms and conditions across all versions of the project.

# 8. Name and Trademark Clause

Even if not formally registered as trademarks, their use is strictly regulated as follows:

## 8.1 Official Reference and Affiliation

## 8.2 Prohibited Uses

- Using the name or logos (official or unofficial) to **mislead others into believing a product, service, or work is created, endorsed, or affiliated with FreeIdeas** is strictly forbidden.

- Any commercial or unauthorized use of the name or logos remains prohibited without prior written permission from the author.

This clause ensures that the identity of FreeIdeas is preserved, while allowing limited and transparent references in documentation and discussion.
